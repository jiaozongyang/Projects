# Projects

Hi Welcome! 

I am currently a first-year student in Business Analytics, University of Southern California. I will use this github site to display projects and share thoughts in my master study journey. The repository is divided into three categories: computer science, data science and financial engineering. In each file, I will upload some small programs I wrote in online courses or  
team projects I do with my teammates within my master curriculum.
