# Projects

Hi Welcome! 

I am currently a first-year student in Business Analytics, University of Southern California. I will use this github site to display projects and share thoughts in my master study. The repository is divided into three categories: data science, computer science and financial engineering. In each file, I will upload some small programs I wrote in online courses or  
team projects I do with my teammates within my master curriculum.

Data Science:
My major is strongly associated with data science, so I have plenty of opportuniteis to use machine learning to solve real business problems. In the meantime, I also want to figure out the algorithms behind each method. Therefore, I am taking Machine Learning Fundamentals (UCSanDiegoX-DSE220x) on edX, through which I can write the algorithms by myself. I will keep uploading codes along with my learning path.

Computer Science
Even though I don't have a background in CS, I do find that understanding algorithms and data structure behind machine learning helps me better apply the methods. Now I have taken two courses on edX: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python (MITx–6.00.1x) and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (MITx–6.00.2x). Personally, these two courses are excellent introductory courses that I would recommend to anyone without CS background. Besides, they have improved my Python skills a lot.

Financial Engineering
Since I come from Finance background, I have always enjoyed surfing in financial market. This semester I am taking Financial Engineering in engineering school. The course includes a variety of concepts and theories that I have learned before. However, in this course I have the chance to use R to deal with real world data with the theories and models. Combining finance and programming is the ONE thing that I enjoy most.
